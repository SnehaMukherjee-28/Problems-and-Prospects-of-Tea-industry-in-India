 Some problem are identified here and the prospects thus identified primarily based on the survey informations.

1.Introduction:
The Indian tea industry is nearly 200 years old. Robert Bruce, a British national discovered tea plants growing in the upper Brahmaputra valley in Assam and adjoining areas. In 1838, Indian tea that was grown in Assam was sent to the UK for the first time, for public sale.Tea in India is grown primarily in Assam, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Apart from this, it is also grown in small quantities in Karnataka, HP, Tripura, Uttaranchal, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Sikkim and Meghalaya. India has a dual tea base, unlike most other tea exporting countries.The tea industry provides direct employment to over 1 million persons. Through its forward and backward linkages another 10 million persons derive their livelihood from tea. In Northeast India alone, the tea industry employs around 900,000 persons on permanent rolls. It is one of the largest employers of women amongst organized industries
In India, Women constitute nearly 51% of the total workforce. The tea estates in the North Eastern India are located in industrially backward areas.
The three most distinct known varieties of tea in India are:
a) Assam tea (grown in Assam and other parts of NE India)
b) Darjeeling tea (grown in Darjeeling and other parts of West Bengal)
c) Nilgiri tea (grown in the Nilgiri hills of Tamil Nadu)
1.2.World Tea Production: India is the second largest producer of tea in the world, producing an average 900,000 tonnes each year.India produces large quantities, which is important because they’re a nation of over one billion tea drinkers, with over 70% of the tea produced in the nation being consumed within the nation instead of exported.

Figure1 world tea-production
1.3.Indian scenario:
India is the largest producer and consumer of tea in the world. India also leads in global R&D in tea industry. India is the largest manufacturer and exporter of tea machinery. Other major tea producers (also developing nations) source equipment and technology from India.The annual per capita consumption in India is low at 650gm compared to other countries like Pakistan(950gm),Sri Lanka(1.2kg),UK(2.5kg) and Ireland (3.16kg). In India, tea cultivation on commercial scale was first started in Assam in 1839 and then it was extended to other parts of the country between 50’s and 60’s of the 19thcentury.Due to certain specific soil and climatic requirements its cultivation was confined to only certain parts of the country

2.Tea Productivity:  The Tea Board had released the September (2016) production data which shows that India lost 44.17 million kg (M.kg) over September 2016 to total 145.83 M.kg.  North India lost 42.14 M.kg to produce 127.54 M.kg while South India lost 2.03 M.kg to produce 18.29 M.kg”, Consequently, our compilation shows that at the end of the first three quarters of 2016, India’s production has fallen to 912.55 M.kg from 923.27 M.kg, marking a marginal fall of 1.16 per cent”.  In the ten months, North India lost 25.79 M.kg to produce 737.87 M.kg. Assam continued to top India’s production table despite a lower output this year. The state produced 464.29 M.kg – as much as 23.33 M.kg less than the relevant months of 2016.  Darjeeling also reported a lower production – 2.07 M.kg against 6.88 M.kg last year.As of 2017, industry sources estimate the country’s production in the current calendar to be around 1257 M.kg in 2017 – some 10 M.kg less than 2016.  But in 2017 India’s production had increased to 1,278.83 M.kg from 1,267.36 M.kg in 2016. This increase of 11.47 M.kg marks a marginal growth of 0.91 per cent. North Indian overall output in 2017 dropped to 1,046.42 M.kg from 1,054.51 M.kg due to adverse weather conditions in many months, marking a marginal loss of 0.77 per cent.
Data table
Table whose 41 columns have been omitted.
2.1. Data Analysis In this project,an attempt has been made to represent the production of tea by analyzing monthly tea production data of india from 2014 to 2019 and to forecast the tea production in the subsequent three years
2.1.1.Objectives The study and analysis has been conducted with a view to fulfill the following objectives: • To represent the linear trend of the tea production by analyzing monthly tea production data of the india from 2014 to 2019. • To forecast the tea production for the subsequent years of 2018,2019,2020.
2.1.2.Methodology
For analysing the tea production in india we collected the required dataset for tea production in all the states containing a part of tea garden in various areas of india from the year 2014 to2019. From within all these states,we select 5 states of geographical importance i.e containing a large area of the tea garden.

On plotting the time series plot of the 5 states we come to the conclusion that they can be broadly classified into catagories based on similarities: • GroupA: (assam,west Bengal)-north india • GroupB:(tamilnadu,kerala,Karnataka)-south india For analysis,we select north india and south india as the representatives of GroupI and GroupII respectively.
2.2.CASe I:NORTH INDIA First we provide a visual representation of the data obtained from NORTH INDIA in a time series plot. >northindia <-read.table("d:/northindia.csv",header=TRUE) >library("ggplot2") >northindia1<-ts(northindia,frequency=12,start=c(2014,1)) >northindia1 >plot.ts(northindia1)
FIGURE2:TIME SERIES PLOT OF NORTH INDIA From the plot we can see that the data might have seasonality with it.So we assume the additive model of the time series i.e. Yt=Tt+St+Ct+It Where Yt = observations of the time series Tt= the value attributable to secular trend St= the value attributable to seasonal component Ct= the value attributable to cyclic component It=the value attributable to variation component And decompose the additive time series into its trend component using R. >northindiacomp<-decompose(northinda1) >northindiacomp >plot(northindiacomp) >plot.ts(northindiacomp$trend) >plot.ts(northindiacomp$seasonal)

FIGURE2:DECOMPOSITION OF ADDITIVE TIME SERIES
FIGURE4:DECOMPOSITION OF TIME SERIES IN ITS TREND COMPONENT Here we can see the trend variation of the no. of tea producory states in north india represented by the uniform crest and troughs over the years.We can also decompose the time series into its seasonal trend.
FIGURE5:DECOMPOSITION OF TIME SERIES IN ITS SEASONAL TREND

2.2.1.Fitting and Forecasting Here,we fit the data on no. of tea producory states in north india from 2014 to 2019 into a suitable model using auto.arima() function in R. An ARIMA model is in the form of ARIMA(p,d,q)model,where,
p=number of nonseasonal autoregressive terms q=number of non seasonal moving average terms d=number of non seasonal differences Here the l ARIMA model used is (2,0,2)with non-zero mean. Coefficient:
MA1(𝜽𝟏) -1.4353 MA2(𝜽𝟐) 0.6248 AR1(𝝋𝟏) 1.6472 AR2(𝝋𝟐) -0.8965
MEAN=83.2553 AIC=817.13,AICc=818.42,BIC=830.79 The model is so chosen by the auto.arima() function as it has the lowest AIC value.[refer to appendix1]. The chosen model indicates that the data for northindia is seasonal and non-stationary.[refer to appendix2] Now the forecasting model is given by 𝒚𝒕=𝝋𝟏𝒚𝒕−𝟏+𝝋𝟐𝒚𝒕−𝟏+𝜺𝒕+𝜽𝟏𝜺𝒕−𝟏+𝜽𝟐𝜺𝒕−𝟐
Using which we forecast the no. of monthly tea production for the years 2020,2021,2022 in R. >library("forecast") >northindia2<-auto.arima(northindia1) >northindia3<-forecast(northindia2,h=36) >plot(northindia3)
FIGURE6:FORECASTING
Here the forecast and 95% limits are given from for years of 2020,,2021, 2021.Hence we conclude the analysis of north india and generalize their conclusion for group A as a whole.

2.3.CASE II:SOUTH INDIA First we provide a visual representation of the data obtained from SOUTH INDIA in a time series plot. >southindia <-read.table("d:/southindia.csv",header=TRUE) >library("ggplot2") >southindia1<-ts(southindia,frequency=12,start=c(2014,1)) >southindia1 >plot.ts(southindia1)
FIGURE7:TIME SERIES From the plot we can see that the data might have seasonality with it.So we assume the additive model of the time series i.e. Yt=Tt+St+Ct+It Where Yt = observations of the time series Tt= the value attributable to secular trend St= the value attributable to seasonal component Ct= the value attributable to cyclic component It=the value attributable to variation component And decompose the additive time series into its trend component using R. >southindiacomp<-decompose(southindia1) >southindiacomp >plot(southindiacomp) >plot.ts(southindiacomp$trend) >plot.ts(southindiacomp$seasonal)

2.3.1.Fitting and Forecasting Here,we fit the data on no. of tea producory states in north india from 2014 to 2019 into a suitable model using AUTO. ARIMA model() function in R. Here the SARIMA(seasonal ARIMA)model selected is (0,0,1),(2,1,0) [12] A SARIMA model is in the form of ARIMA(p,d,q)*(P,D,Q)model,where, A seasonal ARIMA model is classified as an ARIMA(p,d.q)*(P,D,Q) model,where P=number of seasonal autoregressive(SAR)terms D= numbers of seasonal differences Q=number of seasonal moving averages(SMA)terms p=number of nonseasonal autoregressive terms q=number of non seasonal moving average terms d=number of non seasonal differences
Coefficient: MA1(𝜽𝟏) 0.2910 SAR1(𝜱𝟏) -0.5779 SAR2(𝜱𝟐) -0.2642

3.Results and Discussion:
Area under tea in West Bengal has varied between 82705 hectares to 560000 hectares with an average of 321351.72 hectares, registering a simple growth rate of almost 0.75 % per annum as against compound growth rate of 0.70%.
 The value of skewness indicates that there has been shift of area in favour of tea during the early phase of study period.So far about the productions of tea during study period is concernened.
 An average production of 154422.74-thousand-kilogram associate with a simple growth rate of almost 4.69 % per annum.
 Skewness is positive (0.70) while kurtosis is negative (-0.06) indicates that that there has been increase in production during early half of the study period and it remains steady for a long duration. Average productivity of tea in West Bengal is 1524.33 kg-1 ha and ranges between 998 to 3986 kg-1 ha By and large the productivity of tea has recorded a 2.40% compound growth rate during the whole period under study.
 Both skewness and kurtosis were positive indicating been increase in productivity during early half of the study period could not be sustained for longer period
4.Problems of Tea Industry:
The North East tea industry is gradually sinking due to various problems being faced by it. There are many tea gardens which have closed down in recent years due to various problems affecting the industry. Some of these are Red Bank, Dharanipur, Dheklapara, Surendranagar and Bundapani of the Dooars and Raipur Tea estate in West Bengal. In Assam too, many tea estates have closed down or are operating just minimally. The Problem areas of tea industry in north-Bengal have been identified through survey work.
4.1.1 Economical Factors:
• The wage component constitutes over 60% of the total cost of production. Escalating input costs of electricity, fuel, pesticides and agro-chemicals and irrigation, etc. make Indian tea non-competitive in international market..
• Inconsistent investment is not ideal for Tea industry. Most of the labourers come from socially and economically weaker sections of the society and from their native place lying far away.
4.1.2.Social Factors:
• Leaving aside the natives, most of the workers in the tea gardens in Assam and Bengal are the ones who have migrated from states like Bihar, Orissa and Madhya Pradesh, since the later part of the 19th century. These workers are solely dependent on the tea industry for their daily income and livelihood..
• labourers have to stay in over-crowded and unhygienic living conditions in the residential colonies. They live in poor socio-economic conditions and most of these labourers remain ignorant due to illiteracy. The labourers suffer from various diseases and health problems .
• Most of the tea garden labourers are basically from the “Adivasi” community and the local people. These people are the most exploited ones in the tea gardens. Most of them work as part-time labourers as per production requirement and peak season

4.1.3. Technological Factors
• The technology that is used in tea production is not very advanced. New technology innovation is not very advanced the basic product i.e. the tea. Tea industry is not an industry where overnight changes have to be made or production is affected due to new technology.
• Being highly labour intensive technological factors is least affecting the tea industry. India is the largest manufacturer and exporter of tea machinery.Other major tea producers (also developing nations) source equipment and technology from India.
• In the Assam-Darjeeling region, the transportation of goods is highly time-consuming and costly because of the poor condition of the narrow roads.
• The problem of storing premium quality tea has always been there. Due to delay in transportation and lack of storage facilities, the processed tea gains moisture from the atmosphere and deteriorates in quality.
4.1.4. Environmental Factors
• Change in climatic condition is a major cause of the variation in tea production. In south India, tea productivity is better because of almost uniform climatic condition. In North India, winter is cold, therefore, the tea bushes go to dormant stage and as a result productivity goes down during winter months.
• Erratic rainfall pattern causes frequent landslides in the hilly terrain, causing huge damage and heavy losses to the estates.
5. Tea Export:
Having determined the importance of the tea industry in the Indian industry, we also realize that exports are essential for the sustenance of this industry. Indian tea exports have been losing out to competition from Kenya, Sri Lanka, China and other new‐age tea exporting nations.Here we show the tea export of Asian countries (Bangladesh,Srilanka,China,Indonesia,Vietnam,India) in figure 12 and tea export of African countries(Kenya,Malawi,Zimbabwe,Rwanda,Tanzania,Uganda)in figure 13.
Data table

FIGURE12:TEA EXPORT IN ASIAN COUNTRIES
FIGURE13:TEA EXPORT IN AFRICAN COUNTRIES
Exports are essential to earn foreign exchange for the nation and Indian tea had traditionally been a major contributor in this regards.
5.1. Problems of Tea Export:
a) Unfavourable age profile of significant proportion of India’s tea gardens
b) Tariff and non‐tariff measures
c) Changing Consumer Preferences
d) Shift in India’s production
e) Decline in quality
f) Spurious varieties
g) Lack of marketing initiatives

5.2.Tea Export FORECASTING:  Tea in Zimbabwe posted slower growth than other countries due to a dip in production of black tea due to poor weather conditions. Some of the smaller players had to increase their prices, with this resulting in a small drop in consumption.  In 2013, the number of tea houses in Asia and African countries in the world increased.The countries have witnessed a change in consumer perception, with tea drinking becoming popular among younger generations.  Teas offering health benefits are growing thanks to consumers increasingly adopting healthier lifestyles.  Companies such as Tata Global Beverages have introduced Ayurveda-inspired teas containing including tulsi, basil and ginger. We can forecast the tea export of asian and African countries for 2014,2015,2016 using R. 5.2.1.Case1:asian countries:
Fitting and Forecasting Here we fit the data on tea export in Asian countries(Bangladesh,Srilanka,China,Indonesia,Vietnam,India) from 2008 to 2013 into an ARIMA model using R Here the seasonal ARIMA model used is (0,1, 0) Now we forecast the tea export for the years 2014,2015,2016 using the given equation in R
FIGURE14:FORECASTING Here the forecast and 95% limits are given from for years of 2014,,2015, 2016.Hence we conclude the analysis of Asian countries tea export and generalize their conclusion for case 1 as a whole.
5.2.2.Case2:african countries:
Fitting and Forecasting Here we fit the data on tea export in African countries(Kenya,Malawi,Zimbabwe,Rwanda,Tanzania,Uganda) from 2008 to 2013 into an ARIMA model using R. Here the seasonal ARIMA model used is (0,1,0) Now we forecast the tea export for the years 2014,2015,2016 using the given equation in R

FIGURE15:FORECASTING
6. Prospects of Tea Industry:
 Concerted efforts have to be made by different stakeholders to increase the productivity of tea plantations. The extension services should be strengthened to disseminate the technical know-how to the small tea growers located in remote areas.
 The country can get back its place among our traditional tea markets of Russia and other CIS nations by diversification of tea products, quality upgradation and aggressive brand and logo campaign. These efforts would also help in realization of better prices thus improving our competitiveness and profitability of tea industry.
FIGURE16:STATE WISE PER CAPITA TEA CONSUMPTION IN INDIA
This Figure depicts with the help of a multiple bar diagram the per capita consumption of tea for different states in India in decreasing order of magnitude. Here emphasis should be laid on those states for which per capita tea consumption is relatively on the lower side. So the states need to be considered from the right most side of the bar diagram. From this perspective, focus needs to be given for increasing per capita consumption of tea on Bihar, Chhattisgarh, UP, Jharkhand, Goa, West Bengal.. so on and so forth.

 we need to consolidate our distribution channels in these markets and look at developing more attractive retail options to appeal to the consumer.
 As far as our long term strategy is concerned, clearly there is much benefit associated with diversifying in non‐traditional yet fast growing tea consuming nations . This is because these markets are not saturated and the consumers will thus be willing to try out new options.Because of the nascent stage of tea penetration, these markets are still hooked onto black tea and this opportunity must be harnessed. The market for organic and green tea is still comparatively underdeveloped, which augurs favorably for Indian exporters of black tea.
• However, the major competition in these markets will not be from other developing nations like Kenya, Sri Lanka or China, but the major threat will be from the re‐exporters of tea within UK, Germany and Poland. However, it is essential for us to move up the value chain by packaging and marketing the tea according to local specifications as these will grant our exporters higher margins.There is a need to reduce the import of tea in India.
• There is a need for creating awareness among the people, especially among the rural people, regarding the health benefits of tea consumption.
7. Conclusion At the end of this project it can be concluded that:  In most cases,the seasonal peak in the tea production corresponded with the dry seasons of Northern and Southern India where the states are located i.e. the first flush starts in late March.the second flush occurs during end of May to June.this season produces the best quality tea leaves with gold tips,the raw material for the prized “tippy tea”.
 The global scenario as well as Indian Scenario of tea in terms of area, production,exports and imports indicated overall increase in the quantity of tea in the Indian market over last two decades and the trend is increasing.
 General consumption of tea, health benefit effects of tea need to be promoted more vigorously to trap the nonconventional areas of tea in the world for an expansion in the consumption.
 In West Bengal some tea gardens, plagued with low yield, can partially or fully opt,instead of cultivating tea. It is reported that West Bengal Government is extending its helping hand for this switch over.Through these ways, the Indian tea industry can think of sustainability in future keeping in mind the climate change across the globe.

 
APPENDIX
Appendix 1-
The R package which enables the plot function is “ggplot2”.the forecast is the another of the R packages which contains functions such as
 auto.arima()-----for fitting an arima model to the data.
 forecast()-------for forecasting a time series based on a model.
Both the R packages can be downloaded from https:\\cran.rproject.org.
A suitable model selection by auto.arima()-
Forecast package provides function auto.arima() for the automatic selection of arima model.the auto.arima in R uses a combination of unique root test,minimization of the AIC(akaike’s information criterion) and MLE(maximum likelihood estimation) to obtain an arima model.
A model is chosen and vaue of AIC is calculated.the best model is the one with the lowest AIC.the best model considered so far becomes the new current model.now this process is repeated until no lower AIC can be found.
AIC,AICc and BIC:
AIC is an estimator of out of sample prediction error and thereby relative quality of statistical model for a given set of data.given a collection of models for the data,AIC estimates the quality of each model,relative to the each of the other model.Thus AIC provides a mean for model selection.AIC is founded on information theory.when a statistical model is used to represent the process that generated the data,the representation will almost never be exact.so some information will be lost by using the model to represent the process.AIC estimates the relative amount of information lost by a given model.the less information a model looses,the higher the quality of model.in estimating the amount of information lost by a model,AIC deals with the trade off between the goodness of fit of the model and the simplicity of the model.in other words,AIC deals with both the risk of overfitting and the risk of underfitting.
AIC =2k-2ln(L)
Let, k be the number of estimated parameter in the model.
L be the maximum value of the likelihood function for the model.
22
AICc is AIC with a correction for small sample sizes.the formula for AICc depends upon the statistical model.assuming that the model is univariate,is linear in its parameters,and has normally distributed residuals then the formula for AICc is as followed:
𝑨𝑰𝑪𝒄=𝑨𝑰𝑪+(𝟐𝒌2 +2k) /(n-k-1) (Where n is sample size).
the formula for the BIC is similar to the formula for AIC but with a different penalty for te number of parameters.with AIC the penalty is 2k,whereas with BIC ,the penalty is ln(n)k.
AIC is asymptotically optimal or selecting the model with least mean squared error ,under the assumption that the “true model” is not in the candidate set.BIC is not asymptotically optimal under the assumption.
Appendix 2-
Different stochastic model:-
AR(autoregressive) and MA(moving average)
In an AR(p) model ,the future value of a variable is assumed to be a linear combination of p past observation and a random error together with a constant term.
AR(p) model :
𝒚𝒕=𝒄+Σ𝝋𝒊𝒑𝒊=𝟏𝒚𝒕−𝒊+𝜺𝒕=𝒄+𝝋𝟏𝒚𝒕−𝟏+𝝋𝟐𝒚𝒕−𝟐+⋯+𝝋𝒑𝒚𝒕−𝒑+𝜺𝒕
i.e. 𝜺𝒕=𝝋(𝑳)𝒚𝒕
where L is a lag operator such that 𝐿𝑦𝑡=𝑦𝑡−1
On the other hand,MA(q) model,the future value of a variable is assumed to be a linear combination of q past error and the random error together with the mean of the series.
MA(q) model:
𝒚𝒕=𝝁+Σ𝜽𝒋𝒒𝒋=𝟏𝜺𝒕−𝒋+𝜺𝒕=𝝁+𝜽𝟏𝜺𝒕−𝟏+𝜽𝟐𝜺𝒕−𝟐+⋯+𝜽𝒒𝜺𝒕−𝒒+𝜺𝒕
i.e. 𝒚𝒕=𝜽(𝑳)𝜺𝒕
23
ARMA model:
Auto regressive(AR) and moving average(MA) model can be effectively combine together to form a general and useful class of time series model,known as the ARMA model.
ARMA(p,q)model:
𝒚𝒕=𝒄+𝜺𝒕+Σ𝝋𝒊𝒚𝒕−𝒊𝒑𝒊=𝟏+Σ𝜽𝒋𝜺𝒕−𝒋𝒒𝒋=𝟏
i.e. 𝝋(𝑳)𝒚𝒕=𝜽(𝑳)𝜺𝒕
Here, 𝝋(𝑳)=𝟏−Σ𝝋𝒊𝑳𝒊𝒑𝒊=𝟏 and 𝜽(𝑳)=𝟏+Σ𝜽𝒋𝑳𝒋𝑸𝑱=𝟏
Now,ARMA model can only be used for stationary time series data.however in practice many time series show non stationary behavior.
ARIMA MODEL :
Time series which contain trend and seasonal pattern are also non stationary in nature.thus from an application view point ARMA models are inadequate to properly describe non stationary time series,which are frequently encountered in practice.for this reason the ARIMA model is proposed which is a generalization of an ARMA model to include the case of non stationarity as well.
In ARIMA model nonstionary time series is made stationary by applying finite differencing of the data point.
ARIMA(p,d,q):
𝝋(𝑳)(𝟏−𝑳)𝒅𝒚𝒕=𝜽(𝑳)𝜺𝒕
i.e. (𝟏−Σ𝝋𝒊𝑳𝒊)𝒑𝒊=𝟏(𝟏−𝑳)𝒅𝒚𝒕=(𝟏+Σ𝜽𝒋𝑳𝒋)𝜺𝒕𝒒𝒋=𝟏
SARIMA MODEL:
The ARIMA model is for non seasonal,non stationary data.Box and Jenkins have generalized this model to deal with seasonality.their proposed model is known as the seasonal arima(SARIMA) model.in this model,seasonal differencing of appropriate order is used to remove nonstationarity from the series.
